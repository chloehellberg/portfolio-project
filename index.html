  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I currently call Portland, Oregon home and <strong>love</strong> living in the Pacific Northwest! Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies and these days I've been exploring <em>Indian cuisine</em>. I love fitness and specifically working out with friends. Sometimes the best way to catch up with someone is by taking a long hike and finishing up an adventure with a delicious breakfast.</p>

    <p>My brain likes gathering interesting facts - both important and seemingly useless ones. You've got a weird and random fact - share it with me! Looking to explore the world of software development and start a new career in 2021. There are endless possibilities with tech! If you can dream it - you can create it!</p>
